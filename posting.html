    <h3>
        SillyMC is a personal project of mine that tries to make a enjoyable modded experience on newer Minecraft versions!
        After about 3 weeks it's finally up and I believe it's good enough to be public.
        If you were searching for a new and modern modpack, maybe try mine!
        (though I wonder how you found this website first lmao).
        Initially it was supposed to be called SillySMP, but there was already a SillySMP so I rebranded it about an hour before
        it was approved.
        Another fun fact is that in the meantime of it getting approved I've made this build that I'm pretty proud of!

        I'm running out of things to say... so I guess I'll also do a Dominium Update Teaser!
        I've took my Holiday season with lighter projects like SillyMC and porting essential stuff from Dominium to 1.21.10
        (it was really annoying btw).
        But I wanna finish & publish the update this January.
        It'll be Nether Roof focused, making the place a horror area that gives off
        "You shouldn't be here" vibes.
        There will be awesome rewards, and it's Dominium's way to mess with Netherite.
        That's all I'll currently say.
